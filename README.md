# Nodejs Render API

- Basic Math Test
  This is a basic arithmetic api to test Render hosting. To use this api, make a request to `/math` and provide the operation, and two numeric operands using the query string, 'o', 'x', and 'y' respectively. The operations available are: `add, sub, mult, div`.

- Example
  `/math?o=add&x=3&y=6`.

- Install the packages in the `functions` folder `cd functions` then `npm i`.Run, `npm run serve` to run the local instance.
